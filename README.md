#PolyEngine

An open source Unity-Like physics and game engine built on MonoGame (XNA).

Has physics inspired from Box2D that work well for 2D rigidbodies of any shape including friction and different elastic collisions.

Has a game structure built like Unity so Unity developers can jump into a more open source freeware engine and begin coding.
